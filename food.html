  <p>My favourite Ukrainian dish is Vareniky. Vareniky can be served with a variety of toppings, including sour cream or melted butter. The best vareniky I have ever tried were in Yaremche. They were served with caramelized onions and sour cream. Yaremche is located in the wester part of Ukraine, that is surrounded by beautiful Carpathaun Mountains. In Yaremche people cook food in the traditional ways, which makes it taste even better

  <p>My second favourite Ukrainian dish is Borscht. When I was a child I would always ask my grandma to cook it for me, as she cooked the best borscht ever. Now every time I eat borscht it brings back great family and childhood memories. Borscht is a soup made with beets as a primary ingredient, resulting in a vibrant red color, and often includes vegetables and meat.</p>
